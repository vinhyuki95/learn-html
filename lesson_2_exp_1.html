   </div>
   <br/>
   <div>
     <b>Shop assitant:</b> I see.Our new gift section is over here. Follow me, please!</div>
   <br/>
   <div>
     <b>Juilet:</b> Oh,there are a lot of nice things here. How much is the face cream? I think my mom would really like it. She gets dry skin on the winter.
   </div>
   <br/>
   <div>
     <b>Shop assistant:</b> Well,actually if you buy face cream,you an get a lipstick for half price.
   </div>
   <br/>
   <div>
     <b>Juilet:</b> That's a good offer. Let's take a look.
   </div>
   <br/>
   <div>
     <b>Shop assistant:</b> First,I can recommend this pink rose color. What do you think?
   </div> 
   <br/>
   <div>
     <b>Juilet:</b> Humm,pink is not really her favorite.        </div>
   <br/>
   <div>
     <b>shop assitant:</b> Don't worry, we still have sevaral more options. How about this deep plum color,It's trending at the moment.</div>
   <br/>
   <div>
     <b>Juliet:</b> Oh wow, I think it would usuit my mom really well beacause she has light brown skin. She has a big collection of lipstick,but that one looks diffirent.</div>
   <br/>
   <div>
     <b>Shop assistant:</b> So,it looks like you're really happy with that choice?</div>
   <br/>
   <div class='b'>
